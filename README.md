 I have developed an e-commerce sales analysis dashboard using PowerBI, following my participation in the PowerBI Workshop hosted by TechTip24.
This dashboard features key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Total Profit, Total Sales, Quantity, and Shipping Cost, along with detailed breakdowns by segment, category, and country.
